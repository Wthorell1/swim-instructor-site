  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>With over 5 years of experience teaching swim lessons and 6 years as a certified lifeguard and head lifeguard, I’ve worked with students ranging in age from 3 to 65+. My approach is adaptable, safe, and fun. Whether you're learning to float or training for swim team, I meet you where you are.</p>
  
  <h2>Swim Instruction</h2>
  <p>I teach all levels — from basic water safety for toddlers (like floating on your back, getting to the wall, or climbing out of the water) to advanced stroke techniques (like butterfly, backstroke, and breaststroke) for competitive swimmers. I always incorporate games, positive reinforcement, and techniques tailored to each student’s needs.</p>

  <h2>Private Lifeguard Services</h2>
  <p>Hosting a pool party? Heading to the beach? Hire me as a private lifeguard so you can relax and enjoy yourself knowing someone is keeping a close eye on the swimmers. I specialize in prevention, creating a safe environment before emergencies happen. Please note: I am not an emergency responder or a substitute for 911.</p>
